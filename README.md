4. **Start the Development Server**: Start the development server to begin working with Directus:

## ðŸš€ Hot Reloading for Directus Extension Development  

To enable **hot reloading** while developing Directus extensions, follow these steps:  

### **1. Install `nodemon`** (if not already installed)  
npm install -g nodemon

### **1. Start Development Mode
npm run dev 

**Thats it !**
- Server is running on http://localhost:8055
- my-api on :  http://localhost:8055/my-api
- api raw database access : http://localhost:8055/my-api/product-list-raw-dbaccess-test
- api data access using directus item service : http://localhost:8055/my-api/product-list-item-service-api-test

## Applying a Template to Blank Instance
2. Login and create a Static Access Token for the admin user.
3. Copy the static token and your Directus URL. (http://localhost:8055)
4. Run the following command on the terminal and follow the prompts.

```
$ npx directus-template-cli@latest apply
```

**Development Mode build and run** : script-quickstart.sh to prepare project and run , do this when we do any changes in extension souce
bash script-quickstart.sh

**Notes**
1. Admin Credentails
   Email : admin@admin.com
   Password : admin123
2. This project uses SQLite for quickstart, but you can connect to any other database simply by configuring the .env file.

## Using Mysql Instead of SQLITe : 
Run command : 'npx directus init'
This will create .env with your mysql credentials

## Using PHP php-bo  (PHP BackOffice)
I work on both NodeJS scripts as well as PHP in my project , 
I have added little helper to help you with that in php folder
It Parses and use .env file of root directory
Only Supports MySql as of now.
